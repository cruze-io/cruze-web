As a Designer I aim to match the ideal experience for that particular use case. Coming to this conclusion requires extensive Studying, Prototying & Tracking/Metrics. It is important to back every Product-Decision with Numbers. Metrics help understand not  just the product but the growth of each individual aspect of it.  I extend these practices to every Experience that I create.',
